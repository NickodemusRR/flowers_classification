# Build an Image Classifier using Deep Neural Network

This project implement CNN written using Tensorflow to create image classification.

This project used [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from Oxford of 102 flower categories, with the examples below.

This repository consist of
1. [Project_Image_Classifier,ipynb](Project_Image_Classifier.ipynb): notebook file that shows step by step process of creating image classifier using deep neural network
2. [predict.py](predict.py): python script to run model inference on new image
3. [workspace-utils.py](workspace-utils.py): helper function to tweak udacity workspace for long run experiment

---
From this project I learn about implementation of CNN for image classification and also how to write python script to run the ML model that has been built.
